              <h4 class="article__title">Effective Date: March 23, 2017</h4>
              <p>Tag collects information about you when you use our mobile applications, websites, and other online products and services (collectively, the “Services”) and through other interactions and communications you have with us. If you reside in
                the United States, the Services are provided by Tag USA, LLC and its U.S. affiliates (collectively “Tag U.S.”), and this Privacy Statement applies to information collected and used by Tag U.S.</p>
              <h4 class="article__title">Scope and Application</h4>
              <p>This Privacy Statement (“Statement”) applies to persons anywhere in the world who use our apps or Services to request transportation, delivery, or other on-demand services (“Users”). This Statement does not apply to information we collect
                from or about merchants, couriers, partner transportation companies, or any other persons who use the Tag platform under license (collectively “Merchants”). If you interact with the Services as both a User and a Merchant, the respective
                privacy statements apply to your different interactions.</p>
              <h4 class="article__title">Collection of Information</h4>
              <h4 class="article__title">Information You Provide to Us</h4>
              <p>We collect information you provide directly to us, such as when you create or modify your account, request on-demand services, contact customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. This information may include: name, email, phone number,
                postal address, profile picture, payment method, items requested, profile information, notes, and other information you choose to provide.</p>
              <h4 class="article__title">Information We Collect Through Your Use of Our Services</h4>
              <p>When you use our Services, we collect information about you in the following general categories:</p>
              <p>Location Information: When you use the Services for transportation or delivery, we collect precise location data about the location from the Tag app. If you permit the Tag app to access location services through the permission system used
                by your mobile operating system (“platform”), we may also collect the precise location of your device when the app is running in the foreground or background. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.</p>
              <p>Contacts Information: If you permit the Tag app to access the address book on your device through the permission system used by your mobile platform, we may access and store names and contact information from your address book to facilitate
                social interactions through our Services and for other purposes described in this Statement or at the time of consent or collection.</p>
              <p>Transaction Information: We collect transaction details related to your use of our Services, including the type of service requested, date and time the service was provided, amount charged, coupon used, and other related transaction details.
                Additionally, if someone uses your promo code, we may associate your name with that person.</p>
              <p>Usage and Preference Information: We collect information about how you and site visitors interact with our Services, preferences expressed, and settings chosen. In some cases, we do this through the use of cookies, pixel tags, and similar
                technologies that create and maintain unique identifiers.</p>
              <p>Device Information: We may collect information about your mobile device, including, for example, the hardware model, operating system and version, software and file names and versions, preferred language, unique device identifier, advertising
                identifiers, serial number, device motion information, and mobile network information.</p>
              <p>Call and SMS Data: Our Services facilitate communications between Users and Merchants. In connection with facilitating this service, we receive call data, including the date and time of the call or SMS message, the parties’ phone numbers,
                and the content of the SMS message.</p>
              <p>Log Information: When you interact with the Services, we collect server logs, which may include information like device IP address, access dates and times, app features or pages viewed, app crashes and other system activity, type of browser,
                and the third-party site or service you were using before interacting with our Services.</p>
              <h4 class="article__title">Important Information About Platform Permission</h4>
              <p>Most mobile platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without your consent. And these platforms have different permission systems for obtaining your consent. The iOS platform will alert
                you the first time the Tag app wants permission to access certain types of data and will let you consent (or not consent) to that request. Android devices will notify you of the permissions that the Tag app seeks before you first use the
                app, and your use of the app constitutes your consent.</p>
              <h4 class="article__title">Information We Collect From Other Sources</h4>
              <p>We may also receive information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our Services. For example:</p>
              <p>If you choose to link, create, or log in to your Tag account with a payment provider (e.g., Google Wallet) or social media service (e.g., Facebook), or if you engage with a separate app or website that uses our API (or whose API we use),
                we may receive information about you or your connections from that site or app.</p>
              <p>If your employer uses one of our enterprise solutions, such as Tag for Business, we may receive information about you from your employer. When you request on demand services or a coupon, the store may provide us with a User rating after
                providing services to you. If you also interact with our Services in another capacity, for instance as a Merchant or user of other apps we provide, we may combine or associate that information with information we have collected from you
                in your capacity as a User.</p>
              <h4 class="article__title">Use of Information</h4>
              <p>We may use the information we collect about you to:</p>
              <p>Provide, maintain, and improve our Services, including, for example, to facilitate payments, send receipts, provide products and services you request (and send related information), develop new features, provide customer support to Users
                and Merchants, develop safety features, authenticate users, and send product updates and administrative messages;</p>
              <p>Perform internal operations, including, for example, to prevent fraud and abuse of our Services; to troubleshoot software bugs and operational problems; to conduct data analysis, testing, and research; and to monitor and analyze usage and
                activity trends; </p>
              <p>Send or facilitate communications (i) between you and a Merchant, such as estimated times of arrival (ETAs), or (ii) between you and a contact of yours at your direction in connection with your use of certain features, such as referrals,
                invites, split fare requests, or ETA sharing;</p>
              <p>Send you communications we think will be of interest to you, including information about products, services, promotions, news, and events of Tag and other companies, where permissible and according to local applicable laws; and to process
                contest, sweepstake, or other promotion entries and fulfill any related awards;</p>
              <p>Personalize and improve the Services, including to provide or recommend features, content, social connections, referrals, and advertisements.</p>
              <p>We may transfer the information described in this Statement to, and process and store it in, the United States and other countries, some of which may have less protective data protection laws than the region in which you reside. Where this
                is the case, we will take appropriate measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this Statement.</p>
              <h4 class="article__title">Sharing of Information</h4>
              <p>We may share the information we collect about you as described in this Statement or as described at the time of collection or sharing, including as follows:</p>
              <p>Through Our Services</p>
              <p>We may share your information:</p>
              <p>With Merchants to enable them to provide the Services you request. For example, we share your name, photo (if you provide one), average User rating given by Merchants, Merchant locations;</p>
              <p>With third parties to provide you a service you requested through a partnership or promotional offering made by a third party or us;</p>
              <p>With the general public if you submit content in a public forum, such as blog comments, social media posts, or other features of our Services that are viewable by the general public;</p>
              <p>With third parties with whom you choose to let us share information, for example other apps or websites that integrate with our API or Services, or those with an API or Service with which we integrate; and</p>
              <p>With your employer (or similar entity) and any necessary third parties engaged by us or your employer (e.g., an expense management service provider), if you participate in any of our enterprise solutions such as Tag for Business.</p>
              <h4
                class="article__title">Other Important Sharing</h4>
                <p>We may share your information:</p>
                <p>With Tag subsidiaries and affiliated entities that provide services or conduct data processing on our behalf, or for data centralization and / or logistics purposes;</p>
                <p>With vendors, consultants, marketing partners, and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf;</p>
                <p>In response to a request for information by a competent authority if we believe disclosure is in accordance with, or is otherwise required by, any applicable law, regulation, or legal process;</p>
                <p>With law enforcement officials, government authorities, or other third parties if we believe your actions are inconsistent with our User agreements, Terms of Service, or policies, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of Tag or
                  others;</p>
                <p>In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, consolidation or restructuring, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by or into another company;</p>
                <p>If we otherwise notify you and you consent to the sharing; and</p>
                <p>In an aggregated and/or anonymized form which cannot reasonably be used to identify you.</p>
                <h4 class="article__title">Social Sharing Features</h4>
                <p>The Services may integrate with social sharing features and other related tools which let you share actions you take on our Services with other apps, sites, or media, and vice versa. Your use of such features enables the sharing of information
                  with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the social sharing service. Please refer to the privacy policies of those social sharing services for more information about how they handle the data you provide
                  to or share through them. </p>
